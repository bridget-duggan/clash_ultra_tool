## Description

A web application to get any information on any user and clan! Great for active clans looking to manage and get easy stats.

I use Vercel serverless functions as a proxy between github pages and the clash of clans API. Dev branch is my development branch,
when a feature is developped I push to main, which triggers a workflow that deploys to my live site branch gh-pages. Never merge
gh-pages into main.

This application makes use of the public clash of clans API:
https://publicapi.dev/clash-of-clans-api
https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/

Currently accepting feedback and requests on what to add!
